# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that describes **aspirational features** rather than implemented or available features.

## Files

### GROK-NEW-FEATURES-ASPIRATIONAL.md
**Status**: Aspirational (not implemented)
**Size**: 2,733 lines
**Issue**: Documents features that don't exist in xAI API

**What's wrong**:
- Collections API: No such endpoints exist
- Files API: Not available as documented
- EnhancedGrokClient: Based on non-existent features
- Server-side tools: Unverified/unavailable

**Why archived**: This documentation was written based on anticipated/hoped-for features rather than actual API capabilities verified through Context7 and official documentation.

**Use case**: Reference for future enhancements if xAI adds these features
