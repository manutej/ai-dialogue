# Categorical Meta-Prompting Research Plan

## Objective
Use Claude ↔ Grok dialogue cycles to analyze the categorical-meta-prompting project for:
1. Technical viability assessment
2. Market opportunities
3. Implementation gaps
4. Production-readiness roadmap

## Repository
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/manutej/categorical-meta-prompting.git
- **Local**: `/Users/manu/Documents/LUXOR/categorical-meta-prompting/`

## Research Cycles

### Cycle 1: Technical Foundation Analysis
- What categorical abstractions are correctly implemented?
- Which components need rewriting?
- How does this compare to existing meta-prompting frameworks?

### Cycle 2: Market Opportunity Assessment
- Who would use categorical meta-prompting?
- What's the competitive landscape?
- What's the value proposition?

### Cycle 3: Implementation Gap Analysis
- What's the gap between theory and working code?
- Which features are essential for MVP?
- What can be simplified?

### Cycle 4: Production Roadmap
- What's the path to production-ready?
- What dependencies/integrations needed?
- Timeline and resource estimates?

## Output Structure
Each cycle produces:
- `cycle-N-grok-analysis.md` - Grok's perspective
- `cycle-N-synthesis.md` - Combined Claude + Grok synthesis
- `cycle-N-next-steps.md` - Strategy for next cycle
